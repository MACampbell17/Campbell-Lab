## Research

The life cycle of perennial plants involves transitions into and out of varous states of dormancy. My lab is interested in the genetic response of perennial plants as they transition between different states of dormancy. Potato has been a model system and recently the lab has started investigations into dormancy in grapes.

My research lab is situated on the campus of Penn State Erie,The Behrend College (https://behrend.psu.edu/). I am currently the director of the Lake Erie Regional Grape Research and Extension Center (LERGREC) (https://agsci.psu.edu/research/extension-centers/erie).
